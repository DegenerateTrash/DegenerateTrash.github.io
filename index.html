        <b>'Royal Game of Ur'<br />Mini-Max Intergration</b>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>
          This project was an attempt to implement Minimax into the "Royal Game
          of Ur", a two-player strategy race board game that was played during
          the early third millennium BC in ancient Mesopotamia.
        </p>
        <h3>Why?</h3>
        <p>
          The inspiration for this project was created by watching the video
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I"
            >'Tom Scott vs Irving Finkel: The Royal Game of Ur' by The British
            Museum</a
          >.<br />
          Despite having literally no experience in making AI or the rules of an
          ancient Mesopotamian, I decided that I could make an AI for 'Ur'.
        </p>
        <h3>Initial Problems</h3>
        <p>
          Many of the initial ideas were actually very visible. Such problems
          included the fact that I do not fully understand the rules and that my
          ability to create AI is sub-par due to my lack of investment into
          researching even the most simple AI algorithms. Another glaring issue
          was the fact that I do not even have a working version of 'Ur' nor do
          I know how to program it.
        </p>
        <h3>Todo</h3>
        <p>
          For this project, I will need knowledge of the Minimax algorithm,
          Royal Game of Ur and Processing.js to create the final product.
        </p>
        <h2>The Start of Pain</h2>
        <h3>The Minimax Algorithm</h3>
        <p>
          Before I had even started programming 'Ur' I decided to learn the
          basics of the Minimax algorithm, which caused me to stumble upon the
          video
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ"
            >'Coding Challenge 154: Tic Tac Toe AI with Minimax Algorithm' by
            'The Coding Train'</a
          >. This video was extremely useful for learning how the Minimax
          algorithm worked while also providing an example of its implementation
          into a simple competitive game.<br />
        </p>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          As a disclaimer, I am not an expert. In fact, I only understand 40% of
          the Minimax algorithm as of writing so do not rely on me for
          information on how the Minimax algorithm functions.<br />
          As I understand it the program iterates through all possible solutions
          at that moment in time of which the program then assigns each outcome
          with a specific score. For example, in Noughts and Crosses, a winning
          move will be assigned a score of 1, a tie will be a score of 0 and a
          loss will be a score of -1. The program will then pursue an outcome
          with the score of one and only pursuing an outcome with a score of
          zero when a victory is impossible. When implemented in a simple game
          like Noughts and Crosses it makes the game impossible to win for the
          human, as the algorithm only allows for the human to achieve a loss or
          a tie.
        </p>
        <h2>Noughts And Crosses</h2>
        <p>
          After a brief hour of <strike>copying the code</strike> following the
          tutorial, I was left with a working version of Noughts and Crosses
          which included the Minimax algorithm. Unfortunately, the browser I was
          using decided to crash causing the online p5.js editor to delete all
          code. This forced me to spend another hour writing the code for
          Noughts and Crosses.<br />
          After two hours of <strike>stealing code</strike> following the
          tutorial, I finally had another working version of Noughts and
          Crosses. The working version can be seen below.
